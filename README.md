### **Overview of Projects**

#### **Notebook1**
1. **Pricing Optimization Problem**  
   - **Description:**  
     Models the demand for two products based on price to find the optimal pricing strategy that maximizes profit. The model considers both production costs and price elasticity of demand.
   
   - **Techniques Used:**  
     - Demand modeling based on price variations.  
     - Profit scenario analysis.

   - **Key Insight:**  
     Optimal pricing strategies must balance production costs and consumer price sensitivity to maximize profit.

2. **Component Cost Simulation Problem**  
   - **Description:**  
     This problem involves simulating uncertain component costs for a product with multiple parts. Each component's cost follows a probability distribution (e.g., normal, exponential, or triangular distribution), affecting overall production costs.

   - **Techniques Used:**  
     - Simulation with probabilistic component cost inputs.  
     - Analysis of expected profit and risk of loss.

   - **Key Insight:**  
     Uncertainty in component costs can significantly impact production costs, emphasizing the need for robust cost forecasting and risk management.

#### **Notebook 2**
1. **Production Planning Simulation**  
   - **Description:**  
     A production facility needs to meet uncertain demand with capacity constraints. This problem uses triangular and normal distributions to simulate both demand and capacity and determines optimal production levels to maximize profit.

   - **Techniques Used:**  
     - Probabilistic demand and capacity simulation.  
     - Optimization under uncertainty.

   - **Key Insight:**  
     Effective production planning requires balancing demand and production capacity while accounting for uncertainty to avoid inefficiencies and losses.

2. **Warehouse Location Optimization Problem**  
   - **Description:**  
     This project involves selecting optimal warehouse locations to minimize distribution costs while maximizing service efficiency. The problem is based on a classical optimization approach for facility location.

   - **Techniques Used:**  
     - Optimization algorithms for cost minimization.  
     - Logistics and network optimization modeling.

   - **Key Insight:**  
     Proper warehouse placement has a significant impact on reducing distribution costs and improving service efficiency, especially in complex supply chains.

   - **Description:**  
     This project models and optimizes operations with new variables, including benches and adjusted resource constraints.

   - **Techniques Used:**  
     - Resource allocation modeling with multiple variables.  
     - Advanced optimization and problem expansion.
